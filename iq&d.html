We have linear thinkers among us,2D's. They process information much like a formal logical structure: by line item. They’re fully capable of coming to know complicated systems, thus forming their 2D picture, but it is a somewhat tedious process and things do get lost in translation.The bright people of the world are the “systems thinkers”, 3D. They take in more than a line item at time. They’re able to see how entire systems work, understanding the nuances at play. More so than just a “picture”, they can see into it and readily understand the nature of the system in fundamental ways.There are also 4D's; it’s simulation capacity. Are you familiar with Fermat’s Last Theorem? Euler’s Identity, and the profusion of his works? Gauss? How about Relativity? Einstein’s “thought experiments” were physics simulations, literally! -pretty good ones. All of those things and most other profound innovations humanity has produced throughout the ages came from 4Ds. Operating within existing parameters will keep you there. Such innovations never pop out of existing equations. They have to know it, they have to understand it; they saw it: how it works, interacts, evolves, relates, they saw it. In very pure and intimate ways, they saw it; they generated it. Of course, the vast majority of humans can draw up and run scenarios in their minds, but only these guys are doing it in strict accordance to mathematical and physical law. The world’s best computers are still organic; we’re quantum, of course we’re gonna smoke chips for a good while longer. 4D's are what humanity calls genius; that’s what it is, that’s how it works.</p>
