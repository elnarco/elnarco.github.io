      <h1>Key Features in QM</h1>
<p>Quantum physics has replaced classical physics as the correct fundamental description of our physical universe. It is used routinely to describe most phenomena that occur at short distances. Quantum Physics is the result of applying the framework of Quantum Mechanics to different physical phenomena.We thus have Quantum Electrodynamics, when Quantum Mechanics is applied to electromagnetism,Quantum Optics, when it is applied to light and optical devices, or Quantum Gravity, when it isapplied to gravitation. Quantum mechanics indeed provides a remarkably coherent and elegant frame-work. The era of quantum physics begins in 1925, with the discoveries of Schrödinger and Heisenberg.The seeds for these discoveries were planted by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, and others. It is a tribute to human imagination that we have been able to discover the counterintuitive and abstract set of rules that define quantum mechanics. Here we aim to explain and provide some perspective onthe main features of this framework.We will begin by discussing the property of linearity, which quantum mechanics shares with electromagnetic theory. This property tells us what kind of theory quantum mechanics is and why, it could be argued, it is simpler than classical mechanics. We then turn to photons, the particles of light. We use photons and polarizers to explain why quantum physics is not deterministic and, in contrastwith classical physics, the results of some experiments cannot be predicted. Quantum mechanics is a framework in which we can only predict the probabilities for the various outcomes of any given experiment. Our next subject is quantum superpositions, in which a quantum object somehow manages to exist simultaneously in two mutually incompatible states. A quantum light-bulb, for example, could be in a state in which it is both on and off at the same time!<h2>Linearity of the Equations of Motion</h2><br/> In Physics, a theory is usually described by a set of equations for some quantities called the dynamical variables of the theory.After writing a theory, the most important task is finding solutions of the equations. A solution of the equations describes a possible reality, according to the theory. Because an expanding universe is a solution of Albert Einstein’s gravitational equations, for example, it follows that an expanding universe is possible, according to this theory. A single theory may have many solutions, each describing a possible reality. There are linear theories and nonlinear theories. Nonlinear theories are more complex than linear theories. In a linear theory a remarkable fact takes place: if you have two solutions you obtain a third solution of the theory simply by adding the two solutions. An example of a beautiful linear theory is Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, a theory that governs the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. A field, as you probably know, is a quantity whose values may depend on position and on time. A simple solution of this theory describes an electromagnetic wave propagating in a given direction. Another simple solution could describe an electromagnetic wave propagating in a different direction. Because the theory is linear, having the two waves propagating simultaneously, each in it's own direction and without affecting each other, is a new and consistent solution. The sum is a solution in the sense that the electric field in the new solution is the sum of the electric field
in the first solution plus the electric field in the second solution. The same goes for the magnetic
field: the magnetic field in the new solution is the sum of the magnetic field in the first solution plus the magnetic field in the second solution. In fact you can add any number of solutions to still find a solution. Even if this sounds esoteric, you are totally familiar with it. The air around you is full of electromagnetic waves, each one propagating oblivious to the other ones. There are the waves of thousands of cell phones, the waves carrying hundreds of wireless internet messages, the waves from a plethora of radio-stations, TV stations, and many, many more. Today, a single transatlantic cable can carry simultaneously millions of telephone calls, together with huge amounts video and internet data. All of that courtesy of linearity.More concretely, we say that Maxwell’s equations are linear equations. A solution of Maxwell’s Equation is described by an electric field E a magnetic field B, a charge density ρ and a current density J, all collectively denoted as (E, B , ρ , J). This collection of fields and sources satisfy Maxwell’s equations. Linearity implies that if (E, B , ρ , J) is a solution so is (αE, αB , αρ , αJ), where all fields and sources have been multiplied by the constant α. Given two solutions (E1, B1, ρ1, J1), and (E2, B2, ρ2, J2) linearity also implies that we can obtain a new solution by adding them (E1 + E2 , B1 + B2 , ρ1 + ρ2 , J1 + J2). (1.2) The new solution may be called the superposition of the two original solutions.It is not hard to explain what is, in general, a linear equation or a linear set of equations. Consider the equation L u = 0 , (1.3)where, schematically, u denotes the unknown. The unknown may be a number, or a function of time, a function of space, a function of time and space, essentially anything unknown! In fact, u could represent a collection of unknowns, in which case we would replace u above by u1, u2, . . .. The symbol L denotes a linear operator, an object that satisfies the following two properties L(u1 + u2) = Lu1 + Lu2 , L(a u) = aLu , (1.4) where a is a number. Note that these conditions imply that L(αu1 + βu2) = αLu1 + βLu2 , (1.5)
showing that if u1 is a solution ( Lu1 = 0) and u2 is a solution (Lu2 = 0) then αu1 + βu2 is also a solution. We call αu1 + βu2 the general superposition of the solutions u1 and u2. An example may help. Consider the equation
du
dt +
1
u = 0 , (1.6) τ
where τ is a constant with units of time. This is, in fact, a linear differential equation and takes the form L u = 0 if we define
du L u ≡
dt +
1
u
