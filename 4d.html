      <h1 id="under-construction">4 Dimensional Tesseract</h1><br/>
<p>A four-dimensional cube or tesseract undergoing a rotation along both the XY and ZW planes, simultaneously this completely boggled my mind and just had it simulated. First of all, let me point out, visualization is not four dimensions, rather, it is a representation of four dimensions in three dimensions and is then rendered on a two dimensional screen. What does this mean? Well, let’s take a cube, it’s perfectly fine 3D object, I mean it’s no four dimensional cube or anything but it’ll do for now, we can represent this cube as a series of planes or cross-sections cut along the XY or 2 axes, obviously the 2D planes aren’t actually 3D cubes rather they are representations of 3D objects in a 2D space. If we take two planes one at Z equals negative 0.5 and another at Z equal positive 0.5 and connect these two planes with lines that represent all other possible planes along that axis, we once again see a cube, this is a kind of the visualization we’ll be doing for our 4D tesseract, if we take a cross-section along the W dimension, let’s say at W = -0.5 we’ll find a three-dimensional cube and if we move along the W dimension from W=-0.5 to 0.5 we’ll see that this cube scale in size, now just like in the 3D case, the lines connecting these cubes represent the sum of all cross-sections between the two cubes, therefore this is not a perfect representation but it’s as close as we can get, therefore we have a representation of a tesseract, a four-dimensional cube, now let’s rotate it in a Cartesian XY coordinates, we can rotate a system with a simple rotation matrix in four dimensions, this doesn’t really change, we can see a rotation in the XY simply by tacking an identity matrix onto the end of our rotation matrix so now let’s get a little crazy, what happens if instead of rotating in the XY plane we rotate in ZW plane? Well, this happens, we cannot represent the W plane very well so it looks like one cube rotates around anfmd engulfs the other cube in an endless struggle for dominance, now it doesn’t stop there, because our rotation matrices have two dimensions free at any moment, we may actually perform a special type of rotation known as a “double rotation” by rotating in both the XY and ZW planes at the same time, and with this we can finally replicate the animation on Wikipedia, but wait, there is something I missed a second ago, projections, if we have a four-dimensional point, how do we represent it in 3D? Well the obvious answer is to take a 3 by 4 matrix and multiply by that if we take any arbitrary matrix say the identity matrix with zeroes along the W dimension the rotation doesn’t look quite right, this is because most tesseract depictions use stereographic projections which resemble the act of holding a light source behind an object and checking it’s shadow against the screen, of course for this analogy to work for projections from 4D to 3D we have to assume that our screen can somehow hold three-dimensional objects but let’s ignore that for now. Basically all we need to do is divide every element in the matrix by LW-W where LW is the position of the light source on the W axis and W is a position if that point itself that we are projecting, now here’s the brilliant part, by varying our LW parameter, the location of light source along the W axis, we can see dramatically different visualizations even though the rotation themselves have not changed therefore you have it.The potential term isn’t there because it’s zero so that =Eψ or multiplying through by -2/ħ² we get that d²ψ/dx²=-2m/ħ² Eψ. Now, we remember that E=p²/2m and that P=ħk, the proofs of both of those are in others of my notes and that means P²=2mE u and that K²=p²/ħ² which means a K²=2mE/ħ² so we can write that d²ψ/dx²=1-k²ψ and that’s the wave equation for the particle that is moving freely in no potential, What is the solution of that equation? Well, it has to be solved by a complex func because of the minus term and you find is that it’s solved by ψ=Ae ikx +Be -ikx, how is that true? The answer is that if we differentiate twice with respect to x d²ψ/dx², we effectively have to bring bik twice so we get =A (ik)²e -ikx, well ik squared is minus k squared so we can take the two lots of =-k²[Ae ikx+Be -ikx] but of course that term is simply ψ and therefore you get what we wanted in first place which is d²ψ/dx²=-k²ψ so if that means that this term ψ=Ae ikx+Be -ikx is the solution for the wave equation for a free particle, now, as before we’ve already seen that P=nh/L we showed that momentum was quantisized, n is an integer value, h is Planck’s Constant and L is the length of the line along which the particle is moving of course in one dimension, but E=p²/2m and so consequently E=n²h²/L² 1/2m and that tells you that energy of this free particle is quantisized in units because n can either be 1,2,3 and so on, and if that particle moves between these energy levels then there will be an energy difference which represents the difference between one energy and another and that will give off a photon, and the photon will have an energy which is ΔE=hν where ν is the frequency of the light of which that photon is a part.
