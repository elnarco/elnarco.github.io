      <h1 id="under-construction">Solving the Schrödinger Equation for a Free Particle in a Box.</h1><br/>
      <p>Start the Time-independent Schrödinger Equation -ħ/2m d²ψ/dx² + Vψ=Eψ and V is the potential whatever that may be, could be gravitational, could be electric could be whatever is the energy and ψ the wave func, now for a free particle V=0 and there is potential in which it moves and the particle is simply moving along a line of length L, for simplicity, we’re keeping this in one dimension (1D), so the Schrödinger Equation becomes -ħ²/2m d²ψ/dx².The potential term isn’t there because it’s zero so that =Eψ or multiplying through by -2/ħ² we get that d²ψ/dx²=-2m/ħ² Eψ. Now, we remember that E=p²/2m and that P=ħk, the proofs of both of those are in others of my notes and that means P²=2mE and that K²=p²/ħ² which means a K²=2mE/ħ² so we can write that d²ψ/dx²=1-k²ψ and that’s the wave equation for the particle that is moving freely in no potential, What is the solution of that equation? Well, it has to be solved by a complex func because of the minus term and you find is that it’s solved by ψ=Ae ikx +Be -ikx, how is that true? The answer is that if we differentiate twice with respect to x d²ψ/dx², we effectively have to bring bik twice so we get =A (ik)²e -ikx, well ik squared is minus k squared so we can take the two lots of =-k²[Ae ikx+Be -ikx] but of course that term is simply ψ and therefore you get what we wanted in first place which is d²ψ/dx²=-k²ψ so if that means that this term ψ=Ae ikx+Be -ikx is the solution for the wave equation for a free particle, now, as before we’ve already seen that P=nh/L we showed that momentum was quantisized, n is an integer value, h is Planck’s Constant and L is the length of the line along which the particle is moving of course in one dimension, but E=p²/2m and so consequently E=n²h²/L² 1/2m and that tells you that energy of this free particle is quantisized in units because n can either be 1,2,3 and so on, and if that particle moves between these energy levels then there will be an energy difference which represents the difference between one energy and another and that will give off a photon, and the photon will have an energy which is ΔE=hν where ν is the frequency of the light of which that photon is a part.
